# register-app-argoCD
In this project, we shall build acomplete CI/CD Pipeline using Jenkins, then we integrate the Application SCM GitHub Repository, Maven, Docker, EKS Cluster, Trivy, ArgoCD Slack and the 2nd GitHub repository (which host those Manifest Files) to the Jenkins Pipeline.
Such that, when a Developer makes any changes to the Application source code and pushes it to the GitHub Application Source code Repository, it automatically triggers the Continuous Integration (CI) Jenkins Job. This will immediately pull the Application code from that GitHub Repository and the build process (by Maven) will automatically get initiated. Then Static Code Analysis (by SonarQube) will proceed to perform quality test on the Application. In the Jenkinsfile, it instructs Jenkins to futher package and build the image using the Dockerfile and further push it to our defined DockerHub Repository. After that this created Docker Image will go through a scanning process by Trivy-scan to eliminate any vulnerabilities. This action ends the CI Job.
When everything is automated, the Continuous Deployment (CD) Job still defined in Jenkins as the 2nd Job get trigerred immediately. It will first of all update the the Build Number (the Release Number) in the Deployment Yaml File within the 2nd GitHub Repository that is hosting all the Kubernetes Manifest Files. From that 2nd GitHub Repository, ArgoCD which is installed in the K8s cluster will automaticall pull the changes noticed in that 2nd Repo and it will automatically deploy the resources inside the EKS Cluster. 
And once that CD Job is completed, it will send a notification on Slack to the entire team or it can send an email to team members concerned.

                                           -- Implementation --
We shall use the Jenkins Master-Client Architecture, so that the main Jenkins server will not be overloaded.
-
  (1) Install and configure the Jenkins-Master server and the Jenkins-Agent server
 - 
Create a Jenkins Master Server in the Console. so
- Locate and click on "Launch Instance"
  - Name: **Jenkins-master**
  - OS image: **Ubuntu**
  - Amazon Machine Image (AMI): **Ubuntu server 22.04 LTS**
  - Architecture: **64-bit(x86)**
  - Keypair
    - click on "create new keypair"
    - Keypair name: **Jenkins-vm-keypair**
    - click on "create" to create the Keypair
    - Configure storage (Hard Disk): **15 GB**
- Now, click on "Launch Instance" to create the instance
- Now, copy the Public Ip of this Jenkins-Master Vm and ssh into it from your local system
- You should have it as:
- 
ubuntu@ip-172-31-0-62:~$
- 
- Now, first of all update the system.
***sudo apt update***
- Then, proceed to upgrade the system.
***sudoapt upgrade***
- Open and rename the Hostname here.
***vi /etc/hostname***
- Now, Erase everything in there and type this
***Jenkins-Master***
- Now, save and quite.
***:wq!***
- Now, reboot the system.
***sudo init 6***
  
- Now, go to the console and open the Firewall Rule.
- So, go to "Security Group"
- click on "create a Security Group"
- Click on "Edit inbound rules"
- Click on "Add rule"
- Type: ***Custom***, TCP Protocol: ***TCP***, Port range: ***8080***, Source: ***Anywhere ipv4***
- Then click on "create" to create the Firewall Rule

- Proceed to install Java on this Jenkins VM. Use this command to install java.
***sudo apt install openjdk-17-jre***
- Now, check to confirm that Java is succesfully installed.
***java -version***
  
- It should show you the version of openjdk thats running in the system
  
- Now, proceed to install Jenkins. You can go to the Jenkins Documentation page for Ubuntu/Debian and copy the code under "Weekly release"
  ***sudo wget -O /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io-2023.key
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc]" \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian binary/ | sudo tee \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install jenkins***

- now, Enable the Jenkins service to start at boot.
***sudo systemctl enable jenkins***
- Then, Start Jenkins as a service.
***sudo systemctl start jenkins***
- Now, Check the status of jenkins to ensure that its running and Active.
***systemctl status jenkins***
  It should show "Active (running)"
- At this point, JENKINS IS RUNNING IN THIS SERVER.

Our objective is to use the Jenkins Master-Client Architecture, so that we dont overload the Master Server. So whatever command that we pass in the Master will get executed in the Client Server. So, we now proceed to create a Client Sevrer. so go back to the console and create a client server.so
- Click again on "Launch Instance"
   - Name: ***Jenkins-Agent***
   - OS: ***Ubuntu***
   - Amazon Machine Image (AMI): ***Ubuntu server 22.04 LTS***
   - Architecture: ***64-bit(x86)***
   - Keypair: select our keypair: **Jenkins-vm-keypair**
   - Configure Storage: Hard Disk): ***15 GB***
- Then click on "Launch Instance" to create the Jenkins Agent VM
- Now, copy the public IP of the Agent VM and use it to ssh into it from your local. it should appear as follows
- 
  ubuntu@ip-172-31-6-16:~$
-
- Now, first of all update the system.
***sudo apt update***
- Then, proceed to upgrade the system.
***sudoapt upgrade***
- Open and rename the Hostname here.
***vi /etc/hostname***
- Now, Erase everything in there and type this
***Jenkins-Agent***
- Now, save and quite.
***:wq!***
- Now, reboot the system.
***sudo init 6***
- it should now appear as follows
- 
   ubuntu@Jenkins-Agent:~$
-
- Also install Java in the Agent. so run this command
***sudo apt install openjdk-17-jre***
- Now, check to confirm that Java is succesfully installed.
***java -version***
  
- It should show you the version of openjdk thats running in the system
- Now, install DOCKER inside this Jenkins Agent Server.
- so do
***sudo apt-get install docker.io***
-Do you want to continue? **y**

- Now, give full rights or permissions to the current User inside the Jenkins-Agent on Docker. Use this command
***sudo usermod -aG docker $USER***
- Now, reboot the system. So do
***sudo init 6***
- Still in the Jenkins-Agent, we shall connect the Jenkins-Agent to the Jenkins-Master fot them to be connected together.
- So, still in the Jenkins-Agent, open the ssh configuration File.
***sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config***
- inside the configuration File, scroll down to locate and uncomment "Public Key Authentication" to turn it to "yes". So uncomment it to appear as follows;
***pubKeyAuthentication yes***
- Then continue to scroll down again to locate and uncomment "AuthorizedKeysFile" to appear as follows
***AuthorizedKeysFile .ssh/authorized_keys .ssh/authorized_keys2***
- Now, save and quite.
***:wq!***

- Now, navigate to the Jenkins-Master server, which is **Ubuntu@Jenkins-Master:~$**
- Proceed to open the configuration file of this Master server. So do
***sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config***
- In here, also scroll down to locate and uncomment "Public Key Authentication" to turn it to "yes". So uncomment it to appear as follows;
***pubKeyAuthentication yes***
- Then continue to scroll down again to locate and uncomment "AuthorizedKeysFile" to appear as follows
***AuthorizedKeysFile .ssh/authorized_keys .ssh/authorized_keys2***
- Now, save and quite.
***:wq!***
- At this point, while still inside the Jenkins-Master, reload the ssh service. So do
***sudo service sshd reload***
- At this point, also go to the Jenkins-Agent and reload the ssh service as well. So in the Agent, also do
***sudo service sshd reload***
- Now, go to the Jenkins-Master server and generate the ssh key. So in the Master Server, do
***ssh-keygen***
- It says "Enter File in which to save the key (/home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa):
***press ENTER on your keyboard***
- It further says "Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
***press ENTER on your keyboard again***
- It also says "Enter same passphrase again"
***press ENTER again on your keyboard***
- The key has been generated
- Now do ***pwd*** to ensure that you are inside /home/ubuntu
- Now, go into .ssh directory. so do
***cd .ssh/***
- Inside this .ssh directory, do **ls**
- You will see "authorized_keys"
- You will also see both your private key **id_rsa** and the public key **id_rsa.pub**
- Now, open the public key. So do
***cat id_rsa.pub***
- Now, copy the complete key from "**ssh** all the way to the end **-master**"

- Now, go into the Jenkins-Agent server where you have **ubuntu@Jenkins-Agent:~$**
- Here, do ***pwd*** to see that you are in **/home/ubuntu**
- Then, go to the **.ssh** Directory. so do
***cd .ssh/***
- Inside this Directory, do **ls**
- You will see a File called **authorized_keys**
- Now, get into this "**authorized_keys**" and paste that public key of the Jenkins-Master server here
  "If you cat authorized_key File, you will see both the private and the public key"
- Now, get inside the Public Key and you go below that public key and paste the public key of the Jenkins-Master server that you copied
- Then save and quit
***:wq!***
- Now, cat the authorized_key file to see those 2 public keys aligned there. So do
***cat authorized_keys***
- you will see a "READONLY" public key content of the Agent first above it, then you see the public key content of the Master second directly below it
-
(2) Access the Jenkins-Master Server and configure Jenkins to integrate the Agent to the Master Node
-
- **So, copy the Public IP of the Jenkins-Master and take it to a Browser to open it with port 8080**
  - **172.31.0.62:8080**
- Now, unlock Jenkins. so
  - Copy the path in red and take it to the Master Node to generate the needed password. so
  - While in the Master Node, do ***sudo cat <paste that path here>***
  - Now, copy the password and take it to the Jenkins UI
  - Paste the Password in the "Administrator Password" box
  - Then click on ***Continue***
  - Click on ***install suggested plugins***
    
- **CREATE FIRST ADMIN USER**
  - Usernamae: ***Clouduser***
  - password: ***admin***
  - confirm password: ***admin***
  - Full name: ***Kenneth***
  - Email address:
- Click now on "Save and continue"
- Then click on "Save and Finish"
- Then click on "Start using Jenkins"
- Now, go to "Manage Jenkins" and click on it
- Now, click on "Nodes"
- Click on "Build-in Node" in the middle. Click on the name itself
  - Then locate on the left and click on "Configure"
  - Number of Executors? **0**
  - Then click on "Save"
- Now, click on **Dashboard** and click again on "Manage Jenkins"
  - Click again on "Nodes"
  - Now, click on "New Nodes" at the top right
  - Node name: Jenkins-Agent
  - Check the box on "Permanent Agent"
  - Click now on **Create**
  - Number of Executors: 2
  - Remote root directory: ***/home/ubuntu*** {this is the home Directory of the Agent Server}
  - Labels: ***Jenkins-Agent***
  - Usage: **Use this node as much as possible**
  - Host: Post the private IP of the Jenkins-Agent here {Because both are in thesame VPC. If they were in different VPC, we can use External Ip}
  - Credentials: **None**
  - Click on "+Add"
  - Then click on "Jenkins"
  - Kind: **SSH Username with private key**
  - ID: **Jenkins-Agent**
  - Username: **Ubuntu**
  - Private Key
     - check the box on "Enter directly"
  - Click now on "Add"
  - Enter the New Secret Below
  - Key
    - Now, go to the Jenkins-Master (i.e ubuntu@Jenkins-Master:~) and do ***/.ssh*** to populate the Private Key to copy it. Copy the Private Key of this Jenkins-Master from ***---BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY*** right up to ***---END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY---***
    - Paste the Private Key here
  - Credentials: Select ***Ubuntu(Jenkins-Agent)*** {which we have just created}
  - Host Key Verification Strategy: ***Non verifying verification Strategy***
  - Now, click on ***Save***
Now the Jenkins-Agent has just been added to our Jenkins-Master

- Now go to the Dashboard and click on "***New item**"
- Enter an item name: **Test**
- Then click on **"Pipeline"**
- Then click on **"OK"**
- Scroll down to locate **"Pipeline"**
- Script: on the box at the right, select ***"Hello world"** {so as to start building the script}
- Click now on ***Apply*** and click on ***Save***
- Click now on "Build Now"
- Now, the Build has been completed succesfully as a test in the Agent. Which means that our connection between the Jenkins-Master and Jenkins-Agent is succesfull. As you can see here saying
- "**Running on Jenkins-Agent in /home/ubuntu/workspace/Test**"
- You can now delete the **Test** job (so as not to confuse us)
- 
(3) Integrate Maven to Jenkins and Add GitHub Credentials to Jenkins
